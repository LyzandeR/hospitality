    Do you know where your website traffic is coming from? It is important for a hotelier to understand which of the affiliates brings traffic 
    to the website. Is it through google search, organic or facebook? At HAIS we are experts at setting up / using any Analytics Platform to 
    inform you about the channels that bring you traffic. If Instagram is bringing you enough traffic on the website, it is better to focus your
    marketing campaign there insteam of a different channel. In addition to the above, attribution modelling will give you an understanding on
    your customer's journey before booking a room.
