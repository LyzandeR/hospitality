The hotel and hospitality industry serve millions of customers every day, each one of which have their own needs and expectations. For a hotel, it
is vital to meet these expectations in order for a customer to return and spread the word about the high quality service that they received. To 
achieve this, hotels have turned to analytics and artificial intelligence.

Additionally, customers are not equal in the eyes of a hotel. Some customers simply check in and check out of a hotel, whereas others spend
a fortune on additional services like room service, spa treatments and sport activities. Identifying the customers with the highest overall
lifetime value is of the utmost importance for a successful hotel. It is very difficult for a hotelier to identify the lifetime value of 
a customer simply by one visit, however with the power of artificial intelligence it can.

Analytics, data science and AI have found their way into lots of industries (e.g. retail and finance) but the hospitality industry has lagged behind in adopting an analytics-first philosophy. 

However, this has started to change:

A pioneering example of how analytics and AI have helped in the hospitality industry includes the US hotel chain Red Roof Inn. During 2013 / 2014
they realised that there is huge value in establishing hotels close to major airports at a point in time where flight cancellations were at 3%. In
absolute numbers, this translated into 90,000 passengers daily. The hotel's marketing and analytics department worked together to find weather and
flight cancellations data sets in order to identify the best possible locations. Once they established the hotels, since they knew that most of 
the potential customers would use their smart phones to find nearby accomodation, they launched a mobile marketing campaign in the affected areas.
This strategy led to a revenue increase of 10% where it got deployed.  

This is only one of the examples where data analytics is being used in the hotel industry. Marriot hotels don't just use analytics for marketing
purposes, but it has been put to use across the hotel's operations. Marriot collect data for weather and local events and use those to forecast
demand and determine the value for each individual room throughout the year with optimum efficiency. This is absolutely vital in an era where 
every customer uses price comparison sites to find the best deals.

The hotel and hospitality industry might be starting now with Analytics and AI, but the volume of data they produce on a daily basis will prove
to be gold for every decision they make, ranging from marketing to every day operations like cleaning. Clients start creating data for the hotel
from the minute they visit the website to make a booking and we expect more and more of this to be used to increase both the hotel service 
quality and consecutively the hotel's profitability.
